# HTML foundations
This is a basic project made as part of the foundations course on **The Odin Project**.

### Some of the things that I used on this assignment:

- The basic boilerplate for an HTML
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Absolute and relative links
- Git commands and commits
- The use of tags:
  - *paragraphs*
  - *headings*
  - *anchor*
  - *images*
- The use of attributes:
  - *language*
  - *charset*
  - *alternative text*
  - *source*
  - *hypertext reference*
