            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dice the potato and the ham</li>
                <li>Cut the onion in slices and then grab the slices in your hands and with your fingers, separate every slices into strips</li>
                <li>Fry the diced potato</li>
                <li>Open the eggs, put them in a bowl, add some salt, pepper, the grated cheese, the diced ham and stir them</li>
                <li>Put some oil in the pan, to prevent the mix from sticking to the surface</li>
                <li>Put the fries in the pan on minimum heat so it has time to cook the inside, and pour the egg mix on top of it, and cover the pan with a lid</li>
                <li>After a couple of minutes, grab the pan by the handle and move it back and forward to see if the omelette is done and moving as a whole</li>
                <li>Grab the pan and lid and quickly flip them over, take out the pan and tilt the lid closer so that the omelette starts to slide into the pan</li>
                <li>After a couple of minutes try to move the pan again, when you see that the slides again, it's done</li>
            </ol>
